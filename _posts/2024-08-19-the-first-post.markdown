# the first post.

well i guess this is where we begin. sort of a cliche but i can say the first beginning of many. yes, i am starting my own blog. this blog will mostly centre around things that interest me. now i must warn you, my interests are quite expansive so yes you might like what i push here, but i do not expect everyone to like what they see here. but nonetheless this is kind of the celebration post. i have been wanting to do this for like a year now and i am finally doing it.

## my plans.

honestly i do not have any plans on making this blog a content thing. i merely want this to act as an outlet to my thoughts. what will my first post be about? something i wanted to discuss for a very long time: **social constructionism**.

## what is social constructionism?

my definition of social constructionism is the process of building a social construct. what is a social construct? anything that is not defined by actual facts but by habits or routine. for example, let's take money as an example. money by some is defined as a way to value commodities, but that is only because we as humans shaped the definition of money to be that.

disclaimer: this is my definition of social constructionism for a more accurate and research based answer i would refer to tom andrews' definition [here](https://groundedtheoryreview.com/2012/06/01/what-is-social-constructionism/).

## what is so interesting about it?

my theory behind why we study the science of social constructs starts from understanding humans. how do we understand humans? we understand them by understanding how they feel and their emotions. the same goes for communities and social classes; we understand them by understanding social constructs. that's my theory anyway.
