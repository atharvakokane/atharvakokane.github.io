# creation of words.

i am reading this book by r.f. kuang called babel which constitutes of this magical world that runs on sorcery related to silver and etymology of words from different languages. it got me wondering what are some words that have interesting histories. turns out there are way more than i thought! around 80% of english is made of loan words.

# words i found interesting.

**clue**
the word clue is taken from word 'clew' in greek mythology. the story is that a king named thesus was lost in a labyrinth and used a ball of yarn or a 'clew' to find his way out. hence, the meaning of clue is to direct us towards the truth.

**shampoo**
shampoo has indian origins and comes from the word 'chapati' (चपति) in hindi which means to press. later the word extended its meaning to washing hair in the 1860s and then washing carpets and other stuff in the 1950s.

**chariot**
latin to me is such an interesting language to me, because it's the parent language to almost every language. the word chariot is derived from the old french word 'char' which means cart, whcih inturn is taken from the latin word 'carrus' which means wheeled vehicle. now, in french chariot means the trolleys that you find in supermarkets. interesting isn't it?

this is just the beginning to a maze of words and languages. if you haven't read babel, i highly recommend it, especially to anyone who loves to study etymology.
