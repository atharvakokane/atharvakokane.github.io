# life gone by.
it has been a crazy 2 months since the end of my mid-term exams. thought i would keep record of all that has happened since then. so what has happened?

# a trip into a dream.
you know those bucket lists places that people want to visit? well, the university of oxford was on my list. guess what? i actually got to visit the university where the famous harry potter was shot. yes, i saw the bodliean and did all the touristy stuff, but i didn't really go there for tourism. i went there for a summer school program. added sql, c and packet tracer to my list of skills and even got myself a letter of recommendation. i found myself surrounded by people from different borders and nationalities yet i still felt like home.
