# life gone by.

---

it has been a crazy 2 months since the end of my mid-term exams. thought i would keep record of all that has happened since then. so what has happened?

# a trip into a dream.

---

you know those bucket lists places that people want to visit? well, the university of oxford was on my list. guess what? i actually got to visit the university where the famous harry potter was shot. yes, i saw the bodliean and did all the touristy stuff, but i didn't really go there for tourism. i went there for a summer school program. added sql, c and packet tracer to my list of skills. i found myself surrounded by people from different borders and nationalities yet i still felt like home. well also, if you ever find yourself at oxford, i would definately recommend blackwell's bookshop. it is the most beautiful bookstore i've been to in a long time.

# my first job.

---

finally, after months of searching i landed an internship in dubai at vision concept aviation training institute, to build a bank management system for their employees. i worked in a group of 5 and improved my file handling skills within python.

# am i a leeter?

---

i also got into leetcode - competitive programming - but initially i wasn't really great at it. practiced it a bit but then i lost interest. maybe i will restart my leetcode journey soon.

- ask.
