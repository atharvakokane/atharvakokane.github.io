# new year '25
---

a new year a new blank slate. every year i always have a set of goals that i always want to achieve. for 2024, unfortunately, i didn't make such a list. this year is going to be different. this is i am going to publicize my list. even though resolutions are meant to be usually private and personal, i think i require a more societal touch. after all the rants i have gone on talking about breaking the loop and escaping the whims of society, maybe sometimes you need to lean back to old ways. so, i have decided to publicize my list on my blog.

now, here are a few things you should know. if these goals on my list are not completed, they are not forgotten they are transferred to my list for next year. furthermore, if i fail to complete these things on my list, they aren't failures, they were unrealistic goals. every year i go very hard on myself when i do not achieve something. i think its time to change that.

well a then then without a further ado do (heh, i thought that was funny ok), here is my list of goals for the annual year of 2025:

 - ~~excel in board exams.~~
 - master davinci resolve and color grading.
 - create a community program.
 - start rowing in university.
 - apply for student government in university.
 - publish atleast 2 research papers.
 - ~~get atleast 1 internship.~~
 - read atleast 5 books.

<br />-- ask.
