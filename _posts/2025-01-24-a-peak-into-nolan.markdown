# a peak into nolan.

---

i recently just watched a few of the greatest films known to existence. out of the many there were exactly two films that really stood out to me, and more than that out of the two there was one that really intrigued my senses than the other. i'm guessing you understood by the title, i'm talking about christopher nolan's interstellar and inception. both movies take on abstract and mind-bending topics, but they both have one element that stays common. nolan always has a unique take on time.

we percieve time to be a construct. something to measure our moments here on this very rock. to nolan, it rejects that perception of infinite and grounds to finite. nolan always takes time to be a very precious resource. his movies display time very vividly and with absolute precision. throughout nolan's direction, he does not just ramp up or slow down but also sometimes bends the entire fabric of time on itself like seen in interstellar.

another detail that christopher nolan's movies possess is the precision to physics. there are many indications to this, including the research done by nolan's brother jonathan nolan for the movie interstellar and the elevator scene with no gravity in inception. the viewer feels out of balance if the movie does not follow real world physics, and nolan has done a great job at keeping his movies as grounded to earth's physics as can be.

i recommend everyone to go watch both of these movies and check out more of <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/" target = _blank>nolan's work</a> and focus on the recurring themes or just have your mind just blow up by the movies that this man creates. he is one of the greatest film directors of this era and i hope to see more of his work soon.
