# break from life.
---

yes i am posting again. yes two days in a row. feels out of pocket for me. felt i needed to vent though. after watching the first half of the social netowrk yesterday again, i think its that time. you know the part of the movie where mark gets drunk and builds a website that crashes the entirety harvard network? i feel like its that time.

maybe not the same, but something similar to that range. now obviously i do not have access to a university server or the coding skills or capability to build anything close to facemash. trying to brainstorm something.

yes, my chemistry board exam is in 4 days by the way. but, i feel like this is a necessity.

in its early days, facebook or as it was previously known, "the facebook" was built on one principle and one principle only. exclusivity. soon enough every university and school started having a private mock up of facebook for their university. some universities even have a sh*tty discord server. my school however, does not. it doesn't have anything, no social platform for everyone, no connected group chats. they just have the private ones on whatsapp or instagram. that's where we begin. 

there is one issue. students in my school do not use their school emails for anything. it is a dormant email just for the teams platform that we have to host online classes. that is the only identifier that breathes exclusivity though. its time for a change. hopefully.

i'll start coding soon enough... if i have the time. besides i have done enough for the school. i think its time to move to bigger projects. but, i want to see where this leads.

until next time.

- ask.
