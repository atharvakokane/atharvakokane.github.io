# the known unknown.
---

so, i promised discussions about more mathematical concepts and i found one that really intrigued me because of how exapnsive its field really is. chaos theory deals with nonlinear things that are effectively impossible to predict or control, like turbulence, weather, the stock market, our brain states, and so on. there are certain models that can represent a chaotic behaviour within a deterministic system.

one example of such a model is the lorenz attractor. first studied by mathematician and meteorologist edward lorenz, the lorenz attractor is essential a set of three differential equations that the rate of change of the x, y and z coordinates of a particular point.

\\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = \sigma (y - x), \quad
\frac{dy}{dt} = x (\rho - z) - y, \quad
\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \beta z
\\]

the above equations when graphed forms a beautiful butterfly shaped three dimensional graph that is changed if there is a slight change in the parameters that are \\[\sigma\\], \\[\rho\\] and \\[\beta\\]. these parameters have been set to the vales below.

\\[\sigma = 10\\]
\\[\rho = 28\\]
\\[\beta = \frac{8}{3}\\]
