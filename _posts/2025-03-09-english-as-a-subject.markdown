# english as a subject.
---

i swear, english seems so easy to everyone else, but for me it's such a hassle. first of all, its the most boring subject. then its your friends who seem like they are shakesspears and wordsworths of today. they start studying 1 day before the exam and still achieve amazing grades. only if it were that simple for me. my english board exam is day after tomorrow and i just finished doing 1 literature chapter, out of 19. yes... i am screwed.

i feel like i am so screwed, but let's see. i just hope i finish the first textbook today. and yes, we have 2 textbooks. lord i hate cbse. well that's all. just wanted to complain a little about my most hated subject. yes, ma'am it is a mundane subject to me (sorry, only my classmates will get the reference).

- ask.
