# the last (actual) board.
---

yes, today was my last board. well, not technically, but computer science is super easy so i am not counting that. finally, the end of my high school life. what do i think about it? it was shit. i am so glad i am through it. well, there are some people that i hold close, but did not really grow. but, i guess that time is now. i have much planned for the coming months so do stay tuned. i will be blogging way more.

i am also attending the <a href = "https://www.uae-innovaite.com/" target = _blank>uae innovaite hackathon 2025</a>, so if you want to network, meet me there. i will also be starting a few research papers that i wanted to start. soon enough i will also be revealing something, and by soon enough i mean in about a year. this is something that has been quite close to my heart for a while, and i am finally implementing it.

if i were to give a younger version of myself advice on how to get through high school, i would say, stop giving a sh*t about what everyone else is doing. focus on yourself and start growing your skills. academics is important, but what is more important is how you are trained for the real world. i would say read more, observe more, explore more and experience more. oh, and also, everytime you are given an opportunity to travel, never turn it down.

that's all from me today. see you guys tomorrow.

- ask.
