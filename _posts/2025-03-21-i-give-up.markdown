# i give up.
---

sometimes i wonder if i was a waste of a life, a waste of oxygen. a glitch in the system, an existence that serves no greater purpose. i try to trace my steps, to find a moment where i was truly necessaryâ€”where the world would have been different without me. i keep replaying the mistakes that i've made, the bridges i've burned to truly understand if it was all worth it.

i keep chasing this goal of becoming something better, something greater, just to find out that it doesn't exist. you see, the perfect being does not exist. people you love will eventually leave, things you love will become a burden, because the only thing permenant in this world is impermenance. 

f*ck society, but why? society has built this image of what it expects me to be. the smallest mistakes lead to a path in life that i did not expect to take or did not even want. it is the smallest things that build or break relationships. today, i lost one such relationship. funny thing is i do not even know what mistake i committed.

maybe one day i will understand. if you are reading this... i still do like you.

- ask.
