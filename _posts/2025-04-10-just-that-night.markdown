and it happened again. now, context on what happened? i don't want to get into it. but i know this, it only ends one of two ways. it seems as plain as black and white. nothing in this world seems black and white though.

i am trying to compartmentalize it. its my way of dealing with things. so let's build something. question is what should i build?

decided on hating on my school for the last time. let's get some actual feedback shall we? decided to build an anonymous feedback board for the school. need to figure out how to host it though. probably going to use github. i will be using ai to build the website though. i feel a little out of it today. let's see what i can find.

need to learn how firebase works to set up a database to store user entries. apparently sql will need a backend and i don't want to get into that when i am running it on github so yea.

so, i forgot that i need to make a new email to make this happen. time to make this happen. prolly will use my other dummy emails. plus i don't know why the script doesn't work. i might do it on visual studio code before importing it to a github.
