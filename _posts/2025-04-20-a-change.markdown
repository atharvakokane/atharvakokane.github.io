# the pivot.
---

realized a few things about people today. they aren't really that 'turing' after all. i've seen people as shades of grey. people full of hatred have more grey areas in life whereas people who have less... well you get the point. a few friends of mine @kovidchopra and @paariunadkhat really made me realize that, people are way more than that. really gave the word 'sonder' a new meaning.

these friends of mine, a few other friends (shoutout @varunshivlani and me have been getting on gmeet calls almost daily these days and today's gmeet call really came with new insights. the proportionality to one's contribution in your life should balance your contribution to their life, most times even lesser. i need to pull myself together. do the things i'm tired of doing but are important. this stuff can be simple, but impactful.

time to make a pivot from the norm.

- ask.
