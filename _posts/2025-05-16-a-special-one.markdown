# a special one.
---

recently attended 2 of my my most dual-sided muns, dxbmun '25 and amitydxbmun '25. why? well i had a bad time at dxbmun (not the fault of the secretariat) because of the beginner delegates in my advanced committee which i was chairing and i had one of the greatest time at amitydxbmun because i spent it mostly with this one delegate who has become something of a prodigy.

well regardless i'm training them and working with them. Hopefully they do get into the crisis side of the mun community. i wish them well and thank you for accompanying me at amitydxbmun. also, thank you to rahul sunil and yogesh damodhar for giving me a chance at amitydxbmun.

p.s. imy h.i.

- ask.
