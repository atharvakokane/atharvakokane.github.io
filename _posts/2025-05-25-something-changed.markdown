# something changed.
---

it's been a while since i've written about my life (non-mun life), so i felt to write about it today. yes, i've changed a lot. i realized it day before yesterday but i didn't know by how much. thank god i have the most wonderful best friends. no honestly guys, thank you haider salik, tanya bhargva and kartikeya jarawat for making me realize where i went wrong. so, after an overnight call that lasted for over 5 hours (i honestly do not know how you guys bare with me) i came to a conclusion. but where did it all start?

now, obviously certain things in life are meant to be kept private. but, i will say this, certain people in life are meant to make you mad enough to work harder and certain people in life are meant to boost your confidence and motivate you to work harder. i had the bad fate of meeting the first type of people in 2023, and since then its been downsailing. i stabilized myself through the last quarter of 2024, but the recent muns have made me tick again. maybe there is another factor, like how my friends said, but i don't think so. for now i've started making a few changes. i hope this doesn't sustain.

haider salik i want to thank you for always keeping me in check, kartikeya jarawat i want to thank you for always making me laugh and smile and tanya bhargva, thank you for making me regain a conscious and returning me back to the logical me that i was. i will never forget you guys.

now, for the changes, i have decided to blog more often. i think it'll help me to clear my mind. so those reading, you better not judge. secondly, i've decided to take certain things slower. finally, i have decided to stop being closed off. i have great friends who i can open up to and that is exactly what i will do.

- ask.
