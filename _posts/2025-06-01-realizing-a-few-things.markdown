# realizing a few things.
---

you can never know any person fully, not even yourself. a good friend of mine, prerna sunil, recently told me to stop looking at emotions as a programming problem or a math equation that can be solved. the only problem with that is that i look at everything in my life like that. i realized that i don't know how to feel.

2024 broke me. i think that's when i stopped feeling. this is the point in the blog where i would start defining the term 'feeling' but as prerna said, maybe i am thinking too much into this. the fact of the matter is that the people that really hurt me, i have the resources to hurt them back, but i never did. i always thought that i would always play it clean. maybe i was wrong. if i played it dirty i wouldn't be in this situation today.

the concept of misinformation is a powerful one. if used properly can cripple the strongest organizations and men. i never used it because it is considered as a dirty tactic (by me, i don't really know what society thinkgs of it.) misinformation of my personal life is what crippled me during 2024 and i learnt to deal with it and ignore it since then. but its returned and this time its affected more than i thought it would.

funny thing is the man in power knows he is wrong, but as long as he can keep his confidence up, he will get whatever he wants. i never fought fire with fire and now its bit me in the ass. maybe i should take a course on politics... might help.

 ps. i will come back to this later.

- ask.
