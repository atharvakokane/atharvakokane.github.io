# in their words.
---

they said he did it
did what? it didn’t matter
the truth got drowned
beneath the clatter

a laugh too loud, a girl too near
a word taken wrong, a look unclear
none of it real
but real enough to smear

they passed his name
like ash on wind
whispered sins
he didn’t commit

every hallway a trial
every glance a knife
they sentenced him daily
to a different life

people don’t need proof
just a story that sticks
and once it spreads
it infects, it clicks

he tried to erase it
with kindness, with grace
but rumors don’t die
they just change their face

he became the lie
even he began to doubt
maybe i’m not as innocent
as i make myself out

that’s the worst part
when the echo grows loud
you start believing
what’s said by the crowd

and so he folded
not with a scream
but like a note
tucked inside a bad dream

gone, not in body
but in soul, in name
the boy who walked in
never left the same.

- ask.
