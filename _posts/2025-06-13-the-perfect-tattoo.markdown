# the perfect tattoo.
---

a friend of mine asked me recently what would my first tattoo and i was clueless. over the past week, i really thought about it and i came to a decision that it would be this beautiful equation below.

\\[e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \\]

its called euler's equation and it isn't just math, its philosophy disguised as a formula. now why this formula? well my life has been a roller coaster and every symbol in the equation resembles a phase in my life. let's delve shall we?

\\(\exp()\\) represents growth, change and life.

\\(\iota\\) represents the imaginary, mystery and contradiction.

\\(\pi\\) represents cycle, unity and the infinite.

1 represents identity and existence.

0 represents nothingness and the void.

and the equation binds them together in perfect coexistence. and how the equation comes to be? well it begins with the taylor series of \\(\exp(x)\\), \\(\cos(x)\\) and \\(\sin(x)\\).
