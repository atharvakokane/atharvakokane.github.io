# the perfect tattoo.
---

a friend of mine asked me recently what would my first tattoo and i was clueless. over the past week, i really thought about it and i came to a decision that it would be this beautiful equation below.

\\[e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \\]

its called euler's equation and it isn't just math, its philosophy disguised as a formula. now why this formula? well my life has been a roller coaster and every symbol in the equation resembles a phase in my life. let's delve shall we?

\\(e\\) represents growth, change and life.

\\(i\\) represents the imaginary, mystery and contradiction.

\\(\pi\\) represents cycle, unity and the infinite.

1 represents identity and existence.

0 represents nothingness and the void.

and the equation binds them together in perfect coexistence. and how the equation comes to be? well it begins with the taylor series of \\(e^{x}\\), \\(\cos{x}\\) and \\(\sin{x}\\).

\\[e^{x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}\\]

\\[\cos{x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n} x^{2n}}{(2n)!}\\]

\\[\sin{x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n} x^{2n + 1}}{(2n + 1)!}\\]

now substitute \\(ix\\) into the exponential series.

\\[e^{ix} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(ix)^n}{n!}\\]

if we split the above equation into odd and even powers.

\\[e^{ix} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(ix)^{2n}}{(2n)!} + \sum_{n=0}{\infty} \frac{(ix)^{2n + 1}}{(2n + 1)!}\\]

if we use the powers of \\(i\\):

 - \\(i^2 = -1\\)
 - \\(i^3 = -i\\)
 - \\(i^4 = 1\\)
 - ...

so...

\\[e^{ix} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n} x^{2n}}{(2n)!} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n} x^{2n + 1}}{(2n + 1)!}\\]

if we substitute the other taylor series into the equation above, then we get.

\\[e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i\sin{x}\\]

and now substitute \\(x = \pi\\) and you get...

\\[e^{i\pi} = -1\\]
\\[e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0\\]

cool right? ok, i'll take a step back from the math of it. just hit me how beautiful the equation was philosophically and plus, i was like addicted to the math behind it since 8th grade. yea, i used to be a math geek (maybe still am). anyways that'll be all today.

tbh i am feeling a little existential today. i haven't done anything in the past 3 weeks and it just hit me. i really need to get back on my projects. i haven't updated the projects part of my website in a month or two. yep, my worst nightmare has come true. i am a useless potato right now. hopefully i change that the coming week. let's see if i can sign up for some events.

 - ask.
