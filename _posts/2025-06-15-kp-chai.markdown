# kp chai.
---

well, how do you fall in love with something as trivial as a cup of chai? well how do we fall in love with people? with memories right? its the same thing. most people in my school fell in love with kp chai because of board exams. they would always go there to have a victory chai after every board exam. i never did. but, today changed everything. i went to kp chai with someone today and this person has turned my world upside down. i'll maintain confidentiality for now, but i am never letting this person go and i hope they don't either.

well other that, need to conduct an experiment soon. i want to ask more people about the fermi paradox and their thoughts and opinions on it. had a discussion about it today, but i still am confused on it. let's see what the public thinks.

ps. this next part is for you. and you know who you are.
