hey guys, been a while. yes i know i have been blogging in cipher recently. let's just say message sent. anyways, it has been a really rough past month. this, i think, is the worst month since 2023 december i have dealt with. but, in the flames of my life right now, grew a phoenix. i recently went with someone to drink chai recently and that memory is a very fond one. i know that they are someone special, but let's see what happens.

i have decided to ignore my mental health for minute again. i found a new startup who wants me to build something for them and thus begins a new project. they need a new website and i decided to collaborate with a good friend of mine. let's see how it pans out shall we? i am meeting the founder today for basic consulting and to see what she wants. im leaving for the meeting now. i will finish this blog later today.

just had dinner after coming back from the consulatation meeting. now, i have a few ideas. let's try them out shall we? i am just going to try to make a custom cursor now using a js and css package. i hope this doesn't crash and burn.

 - ask.
