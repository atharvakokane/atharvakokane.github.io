# need a win.
---

well, yes. i need a win. i have been slacking off. have i been? i mean i did significantly work on my mental side of things. regardless, i do need a win. i started learning kotlin, and by started i mean will start today. i also need to understand why instagram uses django as its backend. time to really get started on this project if i ever am going to succeed. i am going to lay off film for a while (until the 16th) to focus on software, but i will be back. i have something planned for film as well.

also have a pooja to attend in 20 minutes. really need to delve into the intricacies of religion as well. maybe the course on world religions that i am taking might help. i should've really not applied for an llc. the llc is what forces me to take the course on world religions. <a href = "https://llp.vt.edu/llc/aurora.html" target = "blank">here</a> is my llc. well, yea that's all for now. i will update <a href = "https://atharvakokane.github.io/projects" target = "blank">my projects</a> with my kotlin progress soon.

 - ask.
