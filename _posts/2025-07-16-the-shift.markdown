# the shift.
---

alright time to change a perspective. today I was sitting in the dubai metro and really got what sonder meant. about a 60 to 70 people in one box and no one knows what is going on in each others’ lives. weird. at least to me, but really made me make the shift.

i need to focus on myself. like I used to. the outside world is just noise and the occasional friends and family that are along the way and support everything you do. i decided to really start coding and stop just watching these founder and entrepreneur reels. yea, i didn’t start my kotlin journey yet. i also decided to start posting on my socials more consistently. 

i realised that i am a content creator. today, a text solidified that notion. “since ur lwk into the field of content creation.” so, yep expect much more on my instagram and other socials as well. i need to get consistent though.

anyways, that’s all for today. see you guys soon. i’ll be back.

 - ask.
