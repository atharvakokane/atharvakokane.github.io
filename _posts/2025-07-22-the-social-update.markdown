# the social update.
---

if anyone tells me that being an influencer or a content creator is an easy job... i will punch them so hard. WHY IS THIS SO HARD? i did it for 5 days and i found it so hard and difficult. you really have to make each day interesting or you bore out your audience. how do you do this? nonetheless, after a lot of pressure yesterday i put out a few things. today is going to go well aswell. going to the beach in an hour or two. special thanks to ayman sherrif for showing me the ropes of this craft. i will keep it going from here.

now, moving on to my new year's resolutions... i realised some of them are really difficult to do. but, i want to get started on atleast one of them. so i chose to read 5 books these coming months. i am starting with the great gatsby. a classic and also derived into a movie, so it makes it easier to read for me. but, here is the catch: i want to read the book before the movie. this is hard for me because i usually do the opposite to make the reading easier for me. now thank god audio books exist, 'cause this would be impossible without them. i start reading today.

i want to also apply for student government in university, but i realized that it can only happen in the second year 'cause i am an international student and i wasn't there for the elections and i also do not know anyone there. i also am switching my goal of rowing to running a 10k marathon by the end of this year. i will start training as soon as i get there. i am also going to join the mun club there. trying to stay with the craft of debate and diplomacy.

also, beimun '25 was such a huge success onsite. the online conference, not so much. but a win is a win. the team has called me on for the next year as well and i cannot wait to see what beimun '26 has in store for us. hopefully next year i will be in lebanon and be with the team. thank you aya kaddoura and hassan chebab for giving me the oppotunity to perform as a deputy secretary general this year. it was a blast.

that's all for now. i will see you guys soon again. i know that these blogs of mine are getting less and less frequent and i haven't updated my projects page in a while, but i have decided to take a break from my projects for now. i have been focusing on my social sphere for now and just chilling until university begins. virginia tech class of '29 here i come!

edit:
the beach planned was bailed on. time to indulge in some of the greatest movies ever, starting with the great gatsby.

 - ask.
