# social hardship.
---

having a social presence can affect you in a lot of ways. i think for a while, i am going to step back from it. maybe even reconnect with nature for a while (as in the meme way, not actually) and maybe read a book. i restarted reading 'babel' by r.f. kuang. i also need to find another hobby i can do myself. coding has gotten boring. well that's all for now. yes, this one is a short one. yes, maybe i am trying to fix my sleep schedule. later guys.

 - ask.
