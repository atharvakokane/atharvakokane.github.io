# judgement.
---

i was back on social media today when something interesting happened. hatred is really a gentle topic. really needs a new definition in the modern context. i saw someone i know, not anyone close to me mind you, but still someone to me, slandered on a group chat with people who i used to work with and respect. really puts a whole new light on where judgement in society comes from. it comes from society itself.

there is a grey area out there in the world of expectations. you are expected to follow some rules and if you break them you are hated. we need to bring change to this system of love and hate. ideologies really need to change in these times.

 - ask.
