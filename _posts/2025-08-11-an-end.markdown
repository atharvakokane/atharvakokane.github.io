# an end.
---

well here we go. the end to the dubai chapter of my life. yes i will be coming and going, plus there are alot of people here are close to my heart. but i think it is going to be a different chapter of my life starting now.

i don't know what awaits me, but i am excited to see what happens. i will try to not to do anything stupid while in the united states. i don't know if my mun journey will continue while in the us, but i do know i am not going to leave debating. maybe i will see myself at birdmun '25.

engineering is going to be the end of me, but lets see what i can do shall we? plus i got to start training for something that i want to acheive by the end of this academic year. also, now i can focus on my new years resolutions. i already got 5 books that i want to read. let's see if i finish reading them. i need to start researching on something soon as well, literally anything. also start a community program in university. lets see if the university allows me to do that as soon i come in to the university. i also need to decide what the project will be on.

well those are things that i will decide in the future. for now i will miss my best mates, my parents and, i can't believe i am saying this, but my teachers as well. some of them really left an impression on me. good luck to me i guess. see you guys.

 - ask.
