# the mahler measure.
---

it isn't even a week into university and i already have a math equation to understand. i have a math class with prof. arunabha biswas and i checked out his work on the zeta mahler measure. now he is working on the closed formula for the measure. i really want to work with him on that publication, but he told me that the percentage of solving it is really really low. i really want to atleast understand the measure atleast though. so then we begin. the formula to understand is below.

$$
M(p) = |a| \prod_{|\alpha_i| \geq 1} |\alpha_i| = |a| \prod_{i=1}^n \max\{1, |\alpha_i|\},
$$
