# the mahler measure.
---

it isn't even a week into university and i already have a math equation to understand. i have a math class with prof. arunabha biswas and i checked out his work on the zeta mahler measure. now he is working on the closed formula for the measure. i really want to work with him on that publication, but he told me that the percentage of solving it is really really low. i really want to atleast understand the measure atleast though. so then we begin. the formula to understand is below.

$$
m(P) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^n} \int_0^{2\pi} \cdots \int_0^{2\pi} \log \left| P\left( e^{i\theta_1}, \dots, e^{i\theta_n} \right) \right| \, d\theta_1 \cdots d\theta_n
$$
