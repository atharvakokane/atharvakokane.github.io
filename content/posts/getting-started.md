title: getting started with static sites

excerpt: thoughts on building static websites with next.js and github pages
---

static sites are great. no database, no server, just files.

## why static?

- **fast** — pre-rendered html loads instantly
- **simple** — no backend to maintain
- **free** — github pages, netlify, vercel all offer free hosting
- **secure** — no server means fewer attack surfaces

## the stack

this blog uses:

- next.js with static export
- markdown for content
- tailwind for styling
- decap cms for editing

all content lives in the repo. edit in the browser or push markdown directly.
