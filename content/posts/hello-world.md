excerpt: we weren’t born into society, we were booted into it.

i was supposed to release this on the 24th, but it took a bit longer than expected.

people say reality is objective. a fixed set of truths, agreed upon by consensus. but what if consensus is just manipulation wearing a nicer suit?

let’s be honest. the world we live in isn’t real. not in the way we pretend it is. the news is just corporate storytelling. social media is a dopamine factory dressed as self expression. and money — money is faith in numbers that don’t exist. we log in, swipe up, check out, tune in, like, share, pretend. it’s all code. and worse, it’s code we didn’t write.

we weren’t born into society. we were booted into it. pre installed with bugs, forced updates, and malware masked as morality. they tell us to dream big, then sell us those dreams on credit. they tell us to find meaning, but only in their brands, their tech, their politics. they tell us to speak freely, but only when it’s marketable.

here’s a reality most people can’t afford to download: you’re not the user. you’re the product.

we’re watched. constantly. not for safety. not for convenience. for data. for patterns. for prediction. every click, every pause, every hesitation is measured and fed into the machine. and the machine learns. not to help us, but to control us. advertisers, politicians, corporations — all fighting for the most accurate version of you, so they can sell it back to you in pieces.

but society doesn’t want you to know that. it wants you compliant. addicted. comfortable enough to obey. scared enough not to rebel.

you ever walk into a room and feel like everyone is pretending? pretending to care, to believe, to matter? that’s society. one giant performance, and we’re all unpaid extras. the moment you stop clapping, they call you crazy. the moment you question the script, they label you broken.

and people... people will hurt you. that’s the other reality. even the ones who say they care. maybe especially them. they’ll promise loyalty, then sell you out for attention. they’ll preach love, then turn your vulnerability into a weapon.

no matter how much good you do, they’ll find a reason to hate you. to push you out. to call you weird. damaged. dangerous. just for being honest. you trust them, they use you. you open up, they twist it. you stay silent, they still blame you.

because deep down, society is afraid of people who don’t need it.

but maybe broken isn’t bad. maybe it’s the first honest thing in a world built on lies.

reality is this: they created a system where survival is mistaken for success. where obedience is called freedom. where silence is safer than truth. and where love is conditional, always tied to convenience.

and yet, here we are. you. me. reading. questioning.

maybe that’s the glitch they didn’t account for.

maybe we’re still in there somewhere. beneath the usernames. beneath the debt. beneath the algorithm. maybe if we listen closely, we can hear the static. the frequency they tried to mute.

and maybe, just maybe, we can still crash the system.

**ask.**
