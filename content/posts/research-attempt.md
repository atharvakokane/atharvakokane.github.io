excerpt: trying to find something or the other for summer

well, it's time to start applying to shit. i hope literally anything works out. let's begin shall we.

## data science program for the public good program

i applied for this program a week before the deadline during the start of february. i also reviewed my application with the assistant director of the our. hopefully something comes of it, but i don't know if i want to stay at tech for the summer. seems a little lonely. i think i would prefer a city university to do research at.

## spur at the university of utah

applied around the same time as dspg. now, this is something that i am looking forward to. i think utah would be a great place to research. i think i did get rejected though. the participants names are out, and my name is not on there.

## john hopkins university

texted a friend over at john hopkins who is a phd student studying immunology. asked her if the undergraduates that work for her do any data science work, she replied with a yes, but her pi is not keen on keeping them on because she has masters students who are getting paid to do the same thing. she will keep me posted though.

this is not going great, but i will keep going. also hi rishita, if you are reading this.

**ask.**
