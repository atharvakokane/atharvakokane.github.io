title: research for summer

excerpt: the struggle begins
---

i am trying to find something to do for the summer, because i know i am not going to do anything if i return back to dubai. so here is my try to find research programs during the summer. i called up my friend at john hopkins and apparently research right now is difficult. funding has been cut short and the government is not supporting schools this year. i need to mail professors and apply to programs fast. this page will basically act as my checksheet.

i do not know where i should begin though. would these universities even provide me housing? i need to start searching.

**ask.**
