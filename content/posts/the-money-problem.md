excerpt: a mini essay i was proud of
---

last english class i was told to write a mini essay on a song that really speaks to you. i chose ren's 'money game, pt. 2.' i wrote the essay, got feedback from my professor and i was really proud of it, so here is the mini-essay that i wrote.

money is a social construct, and that troubles me. the gold rush mentality that people have of just earning money for the rest of their lives is one of the leading causes of mental alarm and a panic that is set within the feeble minds of humans. the rich have maintained connections in world governments since the end of the world war to maintain their statuses. this allows for a relaxation of taxes for them and poor man is taxed heavily on that account. that is what ren's "money game, pt. 2" tells us. he defines money as "a game and the ladder we climb" and he also explains further that it would "turn(s) a saint into a sinner with his finger in crime." the problem of capitalism is not localized but worldwide, as ren includes examples from the united states, united kingdom and there are other artists like immortal technique that also expand the impact of the corruption of money to south america and india. polarization of the world's population has been carried out by most of the world's presidents and heads of states, which again expands the influence of money. these men who now we call our presidents and prime ministers are not elected by the people or put into power through governmental procedures, but by the corruption of the rich. ren defines them as "those who rise through distorted lies."

i think i did a pretty good job at explaining the problem of money.
