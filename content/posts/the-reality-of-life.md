excerpt: one question pulled me back a year.
---

this one is a diversion from the usual topics that i include in my blogs. this one is kind of serious.

i got a call from one of my old friends today. she asked me about an incident that happened a year back. just asking about it got my entire day on a complete downhill. crazy right? how a few words that takes a few seconds to speak can ruin hours, maybe even days. well today was that one day that got ruined by a few words. of course my friend was not in the wrong by asking me about it. besides she only asked.

so, why? why do we feel so much about stuff in the past? i got some time to think about it today. i think it's a human addiction. memories. everyone has that addiction. throughout my life, i have always looked back and thought about the stuff i did and 2024 was the one year i didn't. i didn't give a sh*t about what i did in the past but i did care about what did on that day. how much did i achieve? how many projects did i do? what did i learn? the only differece was that i thought about what i did that day, not about what i did in the past.

i have always been that guy who needed friends in my life. over the years i realized, f*ck it. you don't need people to succeed. you just need to tell yourself to just **do**. in 2023, i always asked for advice on if i should do this or do that. towards the end of 2024, i realized... nah. i stopped caring about what people thought about my path. my path was finally mine to deal with not anyone else's. 

i quote benedict cumberbatch, "just stop thinking, worrying, looking over your shoulder, wondering, doubting, fearing, hurting, hoping for some easy way out, struggling, grasping, confusing, itching, scratching, mumbling, bumbling, grumbling, humbling, stumbling, numbling, rambling, gambling, tumbling, scumbling, scrambling, hitching, hatching, bitching, moaning, groaning, honing, boning, horse-shitting, hair-splitting, nit-picking, piss-trickling, nose sticking, ass-gouging, eyeball-poking, finger-pointing, alleyway-sneaking, long waiting, small stepping, evil-eyeing, back-scratching, searching, perching, besmirching, grinding, grinding, grinding away at yourself. stop it and just do." (you can see the full speech <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnSMIgsPj5M&t=92s" target = _blank>here</a>.)

quite an influential man. i trust him. but, if you do get friends have friends who challenge you every day. have friends who will beat you down to the ground but will also be happy at your successes. have friends who will push you to your limit.

that's all from me today. finally, i just want to thank my closest friends who pushed me, built me and supported me through 2024 till present day jaiwardhan khatri, hardik gupta, jitvar sisodia, kevin vinod, aryan raj and mohammad sharaf.

**ask.**
