excerpt: a literature project?
---

for the past year now, i have been procrastinating on writing a novel. the most daunting thing about it is that i really do not know what to write it about. i was talking to a friend in december and she told me to just honestly start. i sent her a few of my drafts from before and she said that they were good, i just needed to keep writing.

now, i know what i wrote in my draft for my first few chapters was complete bullshit and i completely scrapped that idea. i want to come up with something new and fast, so that i can immerse myself in a new concept of book.

i was really thinking about writing a second part to the white nights, by fyodor dostoyevsky. i still do not know if that's a great idea or a stupid one. anyways, i asked someone if anyone we knew would be interested. let's see the response.

until then i will be brain-dumping ideas to write about here:
 - a second part to dostoyevsky's white nights
 - something experimental like metamorphosis

i realized that the more i read, or consume the more ideas come to me. but i thought consumption was a plague that corrupts humans now. i think its not just consumption, but what we consume and how we consume.

**ask.**
