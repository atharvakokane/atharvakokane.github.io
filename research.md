# research.

below are the research papers that i have written in the past. hope it's helpful to fellow researchers. also, if you want to reference my work, please do contact me through the <a href = "https://atharvakokane.github.io/contact" target = _blank>contact</a> tab.

## investigating the roots of unity.

The roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation \(z^n = 1\), where n is a positive integer. This paper delves into the intricacies of the Euler’s Formula and also deriving it from Taylor’s expansion of trigonometric functions. The study begins with a foundational understanding of the roots as the solutions to the equation and proceeds to analyze their symmetries, their representation as complex exponential equations, and their behavior under multiplication. The roots of unity form a set of points on the unit circle that are separated from each other by equal angular intervals. This paper further gives cases of roots of unity up to n = 7 and trends that are followed by the roots. Through both theoretical exploration and computational visualizations, this paper aims to deepen the understanding of the mathematical significance of the roots of unity and their widespread applications.

the final formula that was derived from the research is

\[z = e^{\frac{2i\pi k}{n}} = \cos{\frac{2\pi k}{n}} + i\sin{\frac{2\pi k}{n}}\]
